# ===================================================================
# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create either /etc/ranger/rc.conf
# (system-wide) or ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf (per user) and add your custom
# commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
# variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.
# ===================================================================

# Which viewmode should be used?  Possible values are:
#     miller: Use miller columns which show multiple levels of the hierarchy
#     multipane: Midnight-commander like multipane view showing all tabs next
#                to each other
set viewmode miller

# How many columns are there, and what are their relative widths?
set column_ratios 1,3,4

# Draw borders around columns? (separators, outline, both, or none)
# Separators are vertical lines between columns.
# Outline draws a box around all the columns.
# Both combines the two.
set draw_borders both

# Display the free disk space in the status bar?
set display_free_space_in_status_bar true

# Enable the mouse support?
set mouse_enabled true
