# Dot files for WSL environment / Linux environments

## Requirements

Must have WSL, Linux or MacOSX and the shell should be bash

## Install

It is recommended to install this in home directory i.e. ~

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mospy26/dotfiles.git .
```

If installing directly in the home directory is not preferred, then clone the repository normally and run the `run.sh` script.
